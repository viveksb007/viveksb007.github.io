Its about a week since i got my dragonboard410c shipped. Was Reading documentation and stuff so as to not destroy the only MicroProcessor Board i have :P 

Refer **[DragonBoard410c](https://developer.qualcomm.com/hardware/dragonboard-410c)** for Specs

DragonBoard410c is shipped with Android Lollipop by default as of now.
So i found three ways to get started with board right out of BOX :


 1. Connect HDMI output port of board with HDMI monitor or LCD TV, Make sure to connect mouse,keyboard and HDMI before powering up the board. A detailed info is given [here](http://www.96boards.org/forums/topic/short-into-to-start-your-dragonboard-410c-with-hdmi-display/)
 2. By using UART to USB Cable or if you have Mezzanine. Again detailed info [here](http://www.96boards.org/forums/topic/short-into-to-start-your-dragonboard-410c-with-serial-console/)
 3. For some Devs, using Vysor Worked. But i tried and it didn`t Worked. May be because for Vysor you need to Enable Developers Option and USB Debugging.
