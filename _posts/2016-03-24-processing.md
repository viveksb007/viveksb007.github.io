Started with processing in beginning of this month. Listened a lot about capabilities of processing language and trust me it wasn`t a lie.
So as always i began with searching  something to start with on YouTube and found [this Processing Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL374E5107CB62B2BE) ,its great to start with. So without delay i am going to share some stuff that i made on way of learning Processing.

Its just basic stuff, as i don`t know about importing other libraries in Processing.js and for a bit complex see this [repo](https://github.com/viveksb007/Processing), Android and Java Sketches are in the repo.
