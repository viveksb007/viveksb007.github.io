Hey, I'm Vivek!

I'm an Electronics Engineer with a knack for programming. Graduated in **Electronics and Communication Engineering** from **Delhi Technological University (Formerly Delhi College of Engineering)**

I was a **Google Summer of Code Student Developer** under **FOSSASIA** in 2017. Mostly worked on <a href="https://github.com/fossasia/pslab-android">Android Client</a> for <a href="https://pslab.fossasia.org/">**PSLab Device**</a>. Check out my <a href="https://github.com/viveksb007">**Github profile**</a> for more projects.

I was also **Software Developer Intern** for **SAMSUNG Research and Development Institute**. Developed **SAMSUNG ALERT MODE** for Samsung Smart Phones from scratch.

Check out some Android Apps that I made:
- [**Snap Screenshot for Snapchat**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.viveksb007.snapnscreenshot) : This app takes **screenshot in Snapchat without detection**.
- [**PhoneMic**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.viveksb007.phonemic) : This app **converts you Android Device into Mic**. You can connect you Android mobile to external speakers via bluetooth or aux cable and use this app to use for phone as Mic. More description at [http://qr.ae/TUG3jG](http://qr.ae/TUG3jG).
- [**Status Downloader for WhatsApp**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.viveksb007.whatsappstatusdownloader) : App used to save WhatsApp statuses, be it image or video you can simply save it by this app. (Provided you have already viewed the status from WhatsApp status tab).
- [**Watermark Remover for CamScanner**](https://github.com/viveksb007/camScannerWatermarkRemoverAndroid) : This app is open-sourced. It simply removes watermark from PDFs scanned by CamScanner App. More description at [http://qr.ae/TUG3QJ](http://qr.ae/TUG3QJ).
