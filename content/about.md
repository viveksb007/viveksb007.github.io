Hey, I'm Vivek!

Welcome to my corner of the web! I'm currently working as a Software Development Engineer on the AWS Route53 team in the US, where I'm working on DNS (and stuff) on the cloud and on-prem. Before this, I delved into the dynamic realms of cryptocurrency with Coinbase and worked in the banking space for Deutsche Bank.

I graduated in **Electronics and Communication Engineering** from **Delhi Technological University (formerly Delhi College of Engineering)**. During my time as a **Google Summer of Code** Student Developer under **FOSSASIA** in 2017, I acquired skills like Android development, open-source contribution process, etc. In GSOC, my work primarily focussed on developing Android clients for the [**PSLab Hardware Device**](https://pslab.fossasia.org/) and sharing my insights and development journey through technical blog posts on the [**Fossasia Blog**](https://pslab.io/blog/author/viveksb007/). You can explore more of my projects on my [**Github profile**](https://github.com/viveksb007).

During my stint as a **Software Developer Intern** at the **SAMSUNG Research and Development Institute**, I took on the exciting challenge of creating the **"SAMSUNG ALERT MODE"** for Samsung smartphones from scratch. However, it remained a proof of concept that never saw the light of day.

My passion extends beyond the workplace. I'm an avid explorer of new technologies, I like developing utility Android apps, writing technical blogs, and contributing to open-source projects. I'm fascinated by the intricacies of distributed systems and the design choices that underpin their availability and scalability.

I am using this site as a medium to document my learnings in tech/finance/fitness space.
