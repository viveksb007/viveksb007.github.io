Hey, I'm Vivek!

I am currently working on AWS Route53 team in US. Previously, I worked for Coinbase, Deutsche Bank.

I like to explore new technologies, make utility android apps, write technical blogs, contribute to OSS and try to keep myself fit (***in no particular order***). I am fascinated by distributed systems and their design choices for availability and scale.

Graduated in **Electronics and Communication Engineering** from **Delhi Technological University (Formerly Delhi College of Engineering)**

I was a **Google Summer of Code Student Developer** under **FOSSASIA** in 2017. Mostly worked on [Android Client](https://github.com/fossasia/pslab-android) for [**PSLab Device**](https://pslab.fossasia.org/) and wrote blog posts about the project on [**Fossasia Blog**](https://pslab.io/blog/author/viveksb007/). Check out my [**Github profile**](https://github.com/viveksb007) for more projects.

I was also **Software Developer Intern** for **SAMSUNG Research and Development Institute**. Developed **SAMSUNG ALERT MODE** for Samsung Smart Phones from scratch which was a POC and never got released.

**NOTE : All the posts and opinions are my personal view/experience and not related to any organisation I work for.**
